# workshop-models

FreeCAD Models for some of the designs that I found online or created by hand. 

## Repo Structure
- Each project / design should be a folder that contains all the necessary FCStd files.
- Each folder will also contain a STL file which can be rendered directly on Github.
- Each folder can also have an `images/` folder that contain screenshots for the purpose of adding them to README.
